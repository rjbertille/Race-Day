# Race-Day

Control Flow concept:
- if/else statements make binary decision and execute different code based on condition.
- All condition are evaluated to be truthy or falsy.
- The ternary operator(?) and a colon(:) allow us to refactor simple if/else statements.
- Comparison operators, including <, >, <= and >= can comparetwo variablesor values.
- After two values compared, the conditional statement evluates to true or false.
